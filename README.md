# TeamB-IceBreaker
## Iteration 1
- Completed Main Screen
- Completed "W" main structure
- Added tic-tac-toe to online game
- Completed drawer menu
- Completed all major layouts

Currently the app's main structures are all in place as well as layouts.\
All navigation components are done and could be copy pasted to new screens as needed in future\
iterations.\
Many features rely on data base integration which is in a future sprint. However we included some\
temporary hard coded data in the local resources for "WHAT" and "WHO".\
Clear button does not work yet because implementing it without a database in place is not a good\
use of development time, but button logic are all in place and could be done easily.\
