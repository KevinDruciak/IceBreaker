In its current state, our application is fairly functional. The main structures are in place as well as layouts. With its flexible design, it could be readily expanded to include more online games, in-person games, and questions for each category. In the future, we could also implement the ability for users to enter their questions and try to connect with online icebreaking databases in access for more most recent and updated questions.
